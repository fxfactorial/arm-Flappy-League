In order to compile the SDL program, you will need the SDL library:
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev

Check it is installed with this:
$ sdl-config

To use SDL without X, (from the console), you need permissions for framebuffer/
audio/input access. Do the following command and then log out and in again:
$ sudo usermod -a -G video,input,audio <username>

Compile the using the following. The order of some flags matter:
$ gcc <filename>.c `sdl-config --libs` -o <output> -Wall
