This game was made using SDL v1.2, so you will need to install the SDL libraries
and compile the program using them. All the necessary instructions should be
listed below:

Installing the Libraries

In order to compile the SDL program, you will need the SDL library:
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev

Check it is installed with this:
$ sdl-config

You will also need the SDL_image library:
sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev

Compiling and Running

To use SDL without X, (from the console), you need permissions for framebuffer/
audio/input access. Do the following command and then log out and in again:
$ sudo usermod -a -G video,input,audio <username>

Compile the using the following. The order of some flags matter:
$ gcc <filename>.c `sdl-config --libs --cflags` -o <output> -lSDL_image
